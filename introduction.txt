i am following a youtube tutorial by Kunal Kushwaha. 
He was recommended by a friend of mine when i told him that i am interested in learning about java and coading and stuff...

so far, it's been a very cool journey. 

i was doing well at a time, but then i got sick, and haven't had any practice for a while... so i am rusty..

i have forgotten most of the codes and their uses... i am hoping that i will get in touch with them soon as i restart to practice.
